"""FlashRT new-model template — attention specification.

Copy the body of `make_template_attention_spec()` into
`flash_rt/hardware/<hw>/attn_backend.py` (Thor or RTX). The
attention backend itself (the class that holds Q/K/V buffers and
dispatches to FA2 / cuBLAS / FMHA) does NOT need to be subclassed —
the existing `ThorFlashAttnBackend` / `TorchFlashAttnBackend` work
for any model whose attention sites you can describe with
`AttentionSpec`.

# WHAT YOU TRANSLATE
=====================

Your model has N attention "sites" — distinct attention operations
with different shapes / KV layouts. For a Pi0.5-shape model:

Your model code:                              FlashRT AttentionSpec call:
-----------------                             ---------------------------
SiglipVisionTransformer (16 layers, 16        spec.add_site("vision",
   heads, full self-attn, fixed Sq=256/view)      num_layers=16, num_q_heads=16,
                                                  num_kv_heads=16, head_dim=72,
                                                  max_q_seq=256)
GemmaEncoder (18 layers, 8 GQA heads          spec.add_site("encoder",
   over 1 KV head, prompt+vision tokens,           num_layers=18, num_q_heads=8,
   variable Sq up to 512)                          num_kv_heads=1, head_dim=256,
                                                   max_q_seq=512)
ActionDecoder (18 layers, 8 heads,            spec.add_site("decoder",
   self-attn over action tokens, Sq=10 +           num_layers=18, num_q_heads=8,
   cross-attn into encoder KV)                     num_kv_heads=8, head_dim=256,
                                                   max_q_seq=10,
                                                   has_cross_kv=True)

Each site you declare here gets its own pre-allocated Q/K/V tensors
in the backend, sized for `max_q_seq`. The backend exposes
`attn.run("site_name", layer_idx, q_seq=actual_S, stream=stream)`
which the pipeline calls to dispatch attention for that layer.

# WHY SITES?
=============

Different sites have different shapes (vision is fixed Sq, encoder is
variable, decoder cross-attn pulls KV from a different buffer than
self-attn). Pre-allocating per-site avoids reshape gymnastics inside
the captured CUDA Graph. Also, profiling and debugging per-site
(via FVK_RTX_FA2_SITES env var) becomes trivial — see
plugin_model_template.md §"Site-level bisect via env var".

# - [ ] Every distinct attention pattern in your model is one site
#       (don't merge sites with different shapes — graph capture
#       breaks if max_q_seq is wrong).
# - [ ] num_kv_heads correctly reflects GQA grouping (using num_q_heads
#       for both is the most common bug; produces cos ≈ 0.5–0.7 with
#       no other symptoms).
# - [ ] max_q_seq is a hard upper bound on what you'll feed in. The
#       buffer is allocated at this size; runtime q_seq must be ≤ it.
# - [ ] head_dim × num_q_heads = your model's hidden_dim D (this is
#       almost always the case; verify it isn't projected differently).
