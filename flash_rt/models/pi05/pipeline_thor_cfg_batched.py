"""FlashRT — Pi0.5 Thor SM110 fused B=2 classifier-free-guidance pipeline.

Single-inheritance subclass of
:class:`flash_rt.models.pi05.pipeline_thor_batched.Pi05ThorBatchedPipeline`
that runs the conditioned + unconditioned CFG branches as the two
slots of a single B=2 fused forward, mirroring the RTX layout
(``flash_rt/models/pi05/pipeline_rtx_cfg_batched.py``).

Slot 0 carries the conditioned prompt; slot 1 carries the
unconditioned prompt. Both contexts ride the same B=2 ``enc_ae_b2``
graph replay; the **per-step** CFG combine + noise mirror happen
inside that captured graph (see
:func:`flash_rt.models.pi05.pipeline_thor_batched.decoder_forward_b2` with
``cfg_beta`` set), matching RTX
:meth:`Pi05CFGBatchedPipeline.transformer_decoder_batched` and
arXiv:2511.14759 Appendix E:

    for each denoise step:
        v_b2 ← action_head(x_b2)        (per-slot velocity, B=2)
        noise[cond] += v_uncond + beta * (v_cond - v_uncond)
        noise[uncond] ← noise[cond]      (mirror — both slots see
                                          the same x_t at step k+1)

This replaces the previous per-chunk CFG combine (one combine on the
final action chunks), which was an approximation that diverged from
paper-correct CFG at beta > 1 because the cond and uncond
trajectories integrated independently through the 10-step decoder.

    """B=2 fused classifier-free guidance pipeline for Pi0.5 Thor SM110.

    Mirrors RTX
    :class:`flash_rt.models.pi05.pipeline_rtx_cfg_batched.Pi05CFGBatchedPipeline`:
    slot 0 carries the conditioned prompt, slot 1 carries the
    unconditioned prompt, both ride a single ``enc_ae_b2`` graph
    replay, and the per-step CFG combine + noise mirror live INSIDE
    that captured graph (driven by ``cfg_beta`` plumbed through to
    :func:`flash_rt.models.pi05.pipeline_thor_batched.decoder_forward_b2`).

    The frontend's
    :meth:`_capture_enc_ae_graph_b2` recaptures the graph with
    ``cfg_beta`` set when this pipeline is constructed, so changing
    ``cfg_beta`` requires rebuilding the pipeline (same contract as
    :class:`Pi05ThorCFGPipeline` and the RTX equivalent).

    Architectural notes
        * **Calibration scales come from the B=1 calibration pass.**
          The parent's contract is "B=1 calibration transfers to
          B=N". RTX's
          :meth:`Pi05CFGBatchedPipeline.calibrate_fp8` overrides for
          a joint cond+uncond pass to clip uncond's tails — that's a
          follow-on optimization here.
        * **Slot conventions** follow RTX exactly: slot 0 = cond,
          slot 1 = uncond.
        * **The frontend owns the buffers.** This class is a thin
          orchestrator: stages cond/uncond language tokens into the
          two ``_enc_x_b2`` slots via callbacks, mirrors the noise
          into both slots so the diffusion sees identical R, and
          replays the B=2 graph (which carries the per-step CFG
          combine internally).
