"""Smoke + key-coverage tests for the N1.7 declarative WEIGHT_SPEC.

Verifies that:
  * ``build_spec()`` produces a non-empty ``ModelWeightSpec``;
  * every Item key (post layer-fmt expansion + composite-key resolution)
    is present in the actual N1.7 safetensors index;
  * total covered keys = block_items + singleton_items, and the diff vs
    the ckpt's full key set is the documented intentional skip
    (``backbone.model.lm_head.weight`` only — unused at inference time).

Skips automatically when the ckpt is not present (so the test is safe to
run on any machine, including CI without the model).
