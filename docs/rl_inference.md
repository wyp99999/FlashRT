# RL Inference (classifier-free guidance)

Opt-in inference path for advantage-conditioned VLA policies trained
with the RECAP recipe (π\*0.6, [arXiv:2511.14759](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14759)).
At test time the model runs twice per denoising step — once with the
`"Advantage: positive"` indicator appended to the prompt, once
without — and the two velocity predictions are combined to sharpen
the action distribution toward the high-advantage subset:

```
v_guided = v_uncond + beta * (v_cond - v_uncond)
```

This document covers the public API, measured performance on RTX and
Thor, and the numerical contract the implementation meets.

## Scope

|  | RTX | Thor (Jetson AGX, SM110) |
|---|---|---|
| Model | Pi0.5 | Pi0.5 |
| Hardware | RTX 5090 / 4090 (SM89, SM120) | Jetson AGX Thor (SM110, aarch64) |
| Frontends | [`Pi05TorchFrontendRtx`](../flash_rt/frontends/torch/pi05_rtx.py) (safetensors) / [`Pi05JaxFrontendRtx`](../flash_rt/frontends/jax/pi05_rtx.py) (Orbax) | [`Pi05TorchFrontendThor`](../flash_rt/frontends/torch/pi05_thor.py) (safetensors) / [`Pi05JaxFrontendThor`](../flash_rt/frontends/jax/pi05_thor.py) (Orbax) |
| Serial CFG | ✅ 37 ms (β=1.5) | ✅ 88 ms (torch) / 96 ms (JAX) |
| Fused CFG (B=2, paper-correct per-step) | ✅ **25.9 ms** (β=1.5) | ✅ **~67 ms** (torch / JAX, with `autotune≥3`) |
| Generic B>2 batched (RL rollout) | not yet | not yet |

Conditioned-prompt strings are byte-equal across the four frontends
(shared builder in [`flash_rt/core/rl/`](../flash_rt/core/rl/)),
so the same merged LoRA checkpoint serves all four backends.

## API

CFG is opt-in. The default (no `set_rl_mode` call) inference path is
bit-for-bit unchanged.

```python
from flash_rt.frontends.torch.pi05_thor import Pi05TorchFrontendThor

# Construct. autotune>0 enables the B=2 outer-graph autotuner —
# recommended for production, see "Performance" below.
pipe = Pi05TorchFrontendThor(
    "/path/to/pi05_libero_pytorch", num_views=2, autotune=3)

# Recommended: enable the fused B=2 CFG path BEFORE set_prompt.
pipe.set_batched_mode(enable=True, batch_size=2)

# Configure CFG: β must be >= 1.0; π*0.6 paper recommends [1.5, 2.5].
pipe.set_rl_mode(cfg_enable=True, cfg_beta=1.5, advantage_positive=True)
pipe.set_prompt("fold the t-shirt")

# First infer call lazy-recalibrates FP8 scales against the cond
# prompt and (when batched) recaptures the B=2 graph.
actions = pipe.infer(obs)["actions"]      # shape: (chunk_size, action_dim)

# Revert to the standard non-CFG path.
pipe.set_rl_mode(cfg_enable=False)
pipe.set_prompt("fold the t-shirt")
```

The JAX frontend has the same call surface. The four arg-compatible
frontends are `Pi05TorchFrontendRtx`, `Pi05JaxFrontendRtx`,
`Pi05TorchFrontendThor`, `Pi05JaxFrontendThor`.

### `set_rl_mode` parameters

- `cfg_enable` (bool): activate CFG inference. `False` clears any
  previous configuration; the next `set_prompt` rebuilds the standard
  pipeline.
- `cfg_beta` (float, default `1.5`): guidance strength. Must be
  `>= 1.0`. `1.0` mathematically reduces to cond-only output (combine
  collapses to `v_cond`) — useful as a correctness gate but wasteful
  in production; prefer the default non-CFG path for unconditioned
  inference.
- `advantage_positive` (bool, default `True`): conditioned prompt uses
  the positive advantage tag. Set `False` only for debugging the
  guidance direction.

### `autotune` parameter (frontend constructor)

`autotune=N` runs N capture+benchmark trials per CUDA-Graph build
(both the B=1 enc+ae graph and, when `set_batched_mode` is enabled,
the B=2 outer fused-CFG graph). Each trial lets cuBLASLt re-query
its heuristic; the fastest captured schedule is kept.

- `autotune=0` (default): one capture, whatever cuBLASLt picks first.
- `autotune=3`: recommended for RL CFG deployment — eliminates the
  cuBLASLt-tactic variance between Python frameworks (see Performance).
- Higher values cost ~0.5–1 s startup per additional trial.

## Algorithm

`Pi0.5` action expert is a 10-step flow-matching diffusion. Standard
single-forward inference integrates one velocity per step:

```
for k in 0..9:
    v = action_head(x_k, prompt, image)
    x_{k+1} = x_k + v
```

CFG runs the action head twice per step with two prompts and combines
the velocities **per step** (paper Eq. 2; matches `Pi05CFGBatchedPipeline`
on RTX and `decoder_forward_b2(cfg_beta=...)` on Thor):

```
for k in 0..9:
    v_cond   = action_head(x_k, "task\nAdvantage: positive", image)
    v_uncond = action_head(x_k, "task",                       image)
    x_{k+1}  = x_k + v_uncond + beta * (v_cond - v_uncond)
```

Both branches must enter step `k+1` from the **same** `x_{k+1}`
(otherwise the trajectories drift apart and combining their final
velocities is no longer the paper's CFG). The fused B=2 path
enforces this by writing the guided update into the cond slot via
the `cfg_combine_into_residual` kernel and mirroring it into the
uncond slot via a `cudaMemcpyAsync` — both inside the captured graph.

## Internals

```
RTX:     Pi05Pipeline → Pi05BatchedPipeline → Pi05CFGBatchedPipeline    (B=2 fused CFG)
                     → Pi05CFGPipeline                                   (serial CFG)

Thor:    Pi05ThorPipeline → Pi05ThorBatchedPipeline → Pi05ThorCFGBatchedPipeline
                          → Pi05ThorCFGPipeline                          (serial CFG)
```

Each `*BatchedPipeline` runs the encoder + 10-step decoder once at
B=2. Slot 0 is the conditioned context, slot 1 the unconditioned;
the per-step `cfg_combine_into_residual` kernel (single fused
elementwise call, FP16/BF16 packed-2) writes the guided velocity into
slot 0 and a D2D copy mirrors it into slot 1.

The RTX backend captures the entire B=2 forward (vision encoder,
text encoder, per-step decoder, cfg_combine, mirror) as one
`torch.cuda.CUDAGraph`. `forward()` is a single `graph.replay()`.

The Thor backend captures the same shape — outer graph wraps two
B=1 SigLIP runs (one per language slot, lang-emb swap is a graph-
internal D2D from a pre-staged device buffer), one B=2 enc_ae graph,
and the per-step CFG combine + noise mirror inside `decoder_forward_b2`.
`Pi05ThorCFGBatchedPipeline.forward()` calls `outer_graph.replay()`
+ stream sync.

## Performance

### RTX 5090, pi05_libero, FP8, num_views=2

Median over 20 infer invocations after 5 warmup calls.

| path | β | median (ms) | vs baseline |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline (no CFG) | — | **19.0** | 1.00× |
| serial CFG | 1.5 | 37.1 | 1.96× |
| **fused CFG batched** | **1.5** | **25.9** | **1.36×** |

`β` does not affect latency — it is a multiplier inside the combine
kernel only. Fused batched is *faster* than the equivalent generic
B=2 path (27.5 ms) because the cfg_combine kernel replaces (does not
add to) the cond-slot per-step residual_add the generic batched path
performs.

The 25.9 ms median fits inside the 20 ms budget that 50 Hz real-robot
control demands once typical 3 ms control-loop overhead outside
`infer()` is accounted for.

### Thor SM110, pi05_libero, FP8, num_views=2

Median over 50 timed iters per back-to-back A/B subprocess pair, 3
cycles. Both backends use `autotune=3`.

| backend | path | β | median (ms) |
|---|---|---|---|
| torch | baseline (no CFG) | — | **44.6** |
| torch | serial CFG | 1.5 | 88 |
| **torch** | **fused CFG batched** | **1.5** | **~67** |
| JAX | baseline (no CFG) | — | 44.9 |
| JAX | serial CFG | 1.5 | 96 |
| **JAX** | **fused CFG batched** | **1.5** | **~67** |

#### Why `autotune` matters on Thor

Without autotune, the JAX frontend's fused-CFG p50 lands ~3–4 ms
above torch's. Root cause is process-state-dependent cuBLASLt
heuristic divergence — the two Python frameworks load different
`libcublas.so` versions (system 13.2.0 for torch, pip-bundled 13.2.1
for JAX) and start cuBLASLt with different internal cache states.
Given the same `(M, N, K)`, cuBLASLt can return a tactic that
launches ~36 extra `cutlass::Kernel2` sub-launches per inference
in the JAX process.

`autotune=N` recaptures the outer graph N times and keeps the
fastest. Each capture lets cuBLASLt re-query the heuristic; with
N≥3 the JAX backend converges on the same fast tactic torch picks
on the first try. This keeps the heuristic-first design (we never
pin a specific algo, which would brittle-break on cuBLAS upgrades
or hardware revisions) while erasing the cross-backend gap.

#### Why Thor is slower than RTX

Thor's `qkv_split_rope_kvcache_fp16` and `attention_qkv_fp16`
launches run as a per-sample inline Python loop (no batch-aware
fused-attention kernel for SM110 yet); these account for ~20 ms of
the fused-CFG path. The dense FP8 GEMMs amortise across the two
slots correctly (M = B*Seq) — only the per-token-indexed kernels
pay the per-sample cost. A future SM110 batch-aware attention
kernel would close most of the Thor↔RTX gap.

## Numerical contract

Default path (no `set_rl_mode`):
- bit-identical to the pre-RL implementation on all four frontends.

CFG path:
- `cfg_combine_into_residual` kernel vs FP32 reference on random
  inputs at the production size (`chunk_size * action_dim = 320`):
  `max abs diff = 0`, `cos = 1.0`.
- `cfg_beta=1.0` collapse: `cos(CFG, cond_only) >= 0.999` on all
  serial and fused paths, both backends, both hardware platforms
  (mathematical identity: `v_uncond + 1*(v_cond - v_uncond) = v_cond`).
- B=2 slot symmetry: same observation in both slots, identical noise
  R → `cos(slot 0, slot 1) = 1.000000`, `maxdiff = 0` on torch and
  JAX.

### Batched-vs-serial CFG agreement

| β | regime | batched vs serial | batched vs FP32 ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0 | paper default | 0.9997 | 0.9958 |
| 1.5 | moderate (lower) | 0.9991 | 0.9919 |
| 2.0 | mid-moderate | 0.9982 | 0.9854 |
| 2.5 | moderate (upper) | 0.9971 | 0.9756 |

The fused batched path tracks both serial and the FP32 reference
within the FP8 quantisation budget across the paper's full
`[1.0, 2.5]` recommended β range.

### Cross-backend (torch vs JAX) cosine on the same noise R

Same numpy-seeded R fed to both backends:

| β | torch vs JAX cos |
|---|---|
| 1.0 | ≥ 0.9997 |
| 1.5 | ≥ 0.9986 |
| 2.5 | ≥ 0.9979 |

The residual gap (~0.001–0.002) is per-frontend FP8 calibration noise
amplified by the CFG combine; it is not a correctness issue (well
inside the deployment cosine floor of 0.99 vs PyTorch FP32 reference).

## Tests

| test | what it validates |
|---|---|
| `tests/test_rl_cfg_inference.py` | RTX serial + batched CFG, all βs, validation gates |
| `tests/test_thor_rl_cfg_inference.py --backends torch,jax` | Thor serial CFG: validation, β=1.0 collapse, β=1.5 finite |
| `tests/test_cfg_correctness_oracle.py` | per-step C1–C5 contract (RTX) vs frozen reference |

## Troubleshooting

**Calibration warning about scale ceiling during RL mode** —
the conditioned prompt has slightly different token statistics than
pure task text. If the ratio is within ~25× the median, output is
correct; the warning flags calibration-set diversity, not a bug.

**`RuntimeError: cfg_beta must be >= 1.0`** — pass a value in
`[1.0, …]`. `< 1.0` would invert guidance, which the frontend
rejects to prevent silent sign bugs.

**`RuntimeError: set_prompt must be called before calibrate`** —
RL mode rebuilds the pipeline at the next `set_prompt`. Order is
always `set_rl_mode → set_prompt → calibrate`.

**Two `Pi05TorchFrontendRtx` instances in the same process segfault** —
pre-existing single-instance constraint of the calibration path,
unrelated to RL mode. Use one frontend per process (the test suite
does this).

**JAX fused-CFG is consistently 3–4 ms slower than torch** — pass
`autotune=3` (or higher) to the frontend constructor. See the
"Performance" → "Why autotune matters on Thor" section.
